description: Spectroastrometry measures source astrometry as a function of wavelength/velocity. 
Reverberations of spectroastrometric signals naturally arise in broad-line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 
as a result of the continuum variations that drive responses of the broad emission lines with time delays. 
Such signals provide a new diagnostic for mapping BLR kinematics and geometry, complementary to the traditional 
intensity reverberation mapping (RM) technique. We present a generic mathematical formalism for spectroastrometric 
RM and show that under realistic parameters of a phenomenological BLR model, the spectroastrometric reverberation 
signals vary on a level of several to tens of microarcseconds, depending on the BLR size, continuum variability, 
and angular-size distance. We also derive the analytical expressions of spectroastrometric RM for an inclined 
ring-like BLR. We develop a Bayesian framework with a sophisticated Monte Carlo sampling technique to analyze 
spectroastrometric data and infer the BLR properties, including the central black hole mass and angular-size distance. 
We demonstrate the potential of spectroastrometric RM in spatially resolving BLR kinematics and geometry through a 
suite of simulation tests. The application to realistic observation data of 3C 273 obtains tentative, but 
enlightening results, reinforcing the practical feasibility of conducting spectroastrometric RM experiments on 
bright AGNs with the operating Very Large Telescope Interferometer as well as possibly with the planned 
next-generation 30 m class telescopes.
